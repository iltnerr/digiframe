# digiframe: Raspberry Pi-powered digital picture frame

 Displays images on an external display based on playlists.

Features:
- Set display times for playlists and images. For example, display one playlist per day and change images every 5 minutes. 
- Shuffles playlists before cycling through images to avoid repetetive patterns.
- Images are dynamically fit to screen size and empty space is filled with suitable background to make full use of the whole screen.
- Automatically turns display on/off based on defined schedules. (Activates/Deactivates the HDMI Socket, which triggers standby mode if the display supports it)
- Skip current playlist by pressing an assigned button.
